# PureDataGUI
A Web Based GUI for creating, editing, playing, and saving Pure Data patches.

## Motivation
Programming computers is hard, and consequently visual programming languages
have been created to make it easier for non-programmers to create computer programs by manipulating
program elements graphically instead of textually.

One of the earliest and popular example of a visual progamming language for live music performance is [Pure Data](http://puredata.info),
developed by Miller Puckette in the 90s'. While there have been several desk top implementations of the Pure Data, it should be surprising
that there is no implementations for creating Pure Data patches in the browser.  
I believe this primarilly, until recently, stemmed from the lack of a high-level Javascript API standard for inputting, processing, and synthesizing audio.

Now that the WebMidi, and WebAudio standard APIs have become available, I see no major road blocks to make it possible for
musicians and artists to use Pure Data in the browser.
