# PureDataGUI
A web browser based GUI for creating, editing, playing, and saving Pure Data patches.

## Motivation
Programming computers is hard, and consequently visual programming languages
have been created to make it easier for non-programmers to create computer programs by manipulating
program elements graphically instead of textually. One of the earliest and popular example of a visual progamming
language for live music performance is [Pure Data](http://puredata.info), developed by Miller Puckette in the 90s'.
While there have been several desk top implementations of the Pure Data developed over the years, it is only more
recently that [Sebastien Piquemal](http://funktion.fm/#contact) et. al. have created [WebPd](https://github.com/sebpiq/WebPd).

WebPd is a WebAudio implementation that allows users to run Pure Data patches in the browser.  This is a major
step in supporting PureData in the browser, however WebPd is currently 'read only'. There is no GUI, and therefore
no ability to CRUD patches directly in browser.  **PureDataGUI** is a very early stage project that will eventually
fill this gap; allowing users to create, save, edit, play, download and upload Pure Data patches directly in the browser.
